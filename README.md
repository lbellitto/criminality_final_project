# criminality_final_project
My aim is to explain criminality through different factors which can be described as the intervetion of the government over a territory. 

## Project Overview

Data used for this project takes into account different kinds of criminality (e.g. human trafficking, money laundrey...), GDP, and intervention of different governemnts (e.g. law enforcement).  

## Python Packages Used

- **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `numpy` 
- **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Results 
The results show that even if criminality can be partially explained by the level of intervention of each government, other factors (not analysed in the project) affect the dependent variable. 
More studies are requires (for example, application of non linear models). 

## Citation 
I obtained the data from Kaggle [GDP vs. Organized Crime][https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fxvdinxnd/correlation-data].
